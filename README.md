# Digit-Recognition-with-tflite
People's reliance on machines is increasing day by day. People are nowadays dependent on machine learning and deep learning. By using deep learning a lot of critical problems were solved like classification of image, voice recognition, object detection, and many others. In this paper, we will work on ”Handwritten Digit Recognition”. It’s also known as handwritten text recognition, which is the ability of a computer to receive and interest intelligible handwritten input from source search as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens. In this paper, we will build a mobile app that can do by taking handwritten from a touch screen and classify it between 0-9.
